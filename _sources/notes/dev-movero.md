# Developing Movero (MCH)

## Definitions:

- Movero : MCH's verification software (https://github.com/MeteoSwiss-APN/movero)
- DWH Service: the big database of all observational data at MCH

## What ?:

- The current functionality of movero needs to be extended to include snow variables: Snow temperature and Snow height

## Why ?:

- Currently movero does NOT include snow variables and me and sascha have essentially 'rolled your own' solutions - not a very durable approach.
- This development will bring a systematic approach to evaluating snowpolino.
- This work is happening now because DWH service has uploaded imis stations to it's database and therefore, it becomes possible to use movero's extensive framework for this purpose.

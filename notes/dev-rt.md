### 2022-06-17

- starting with jacco's course (https://jacco.ompf2.com/2022/04/13/how-to-build-a-bvh-part-1-basics/)

- create a repo in SOLAR_SHERPA

- create a folder 01_basics for chapter 1

- learnt about :
  - type alias using **typedef**
  - aligned memory allocations using macros
  - default constructor (introduced in c++11)
  - that ubuntu does not ship with intrin.h
  - cleaned up jacco's template to simplify a bit
